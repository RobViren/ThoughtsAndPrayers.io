## Welcome

What is this?
I am working to develop a zero effort crypto charity with maximum transparency and hopeful optimism

How?
The site leverages a browser based crypto mining service to mine XMR, a CPU friendly currency. The backend is currently coin-hive, which does take a cut. I am currently working to figure out a way to get a better rate. It may be possible to replace the backend, or develop a new one. I am open to opinions. I take the earned currecny and convert it to bitcoin, and work with http://donatebitcoin.io/ to send to money to the charity of the week. The charity of the week will be voted on using a google sheet, or some other method yet to be determined.

Problems I need to solve

* Transparency: I really want this to be done well so everyone knows where the money is going.
* UX: I want people to feel good about the experince and make it social if possible.
* Suggestions: I want this to be a community effort that thrives from community input.
